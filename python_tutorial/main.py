# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
#                Functions and classes in this module can be reused without the main block of code executing
# Good practice (code is modular,
#                helps readability,
#                leaves no global variables,
#                avoid unintended execution)
# ex. library = Import library for functionality
#               when running library directly,display a help page

# by using this [if __name__=='__main__'] if you import one module to another we can run
# each python file separately  in this case all program of imported module will not run
# we can select what we want (functionality)
